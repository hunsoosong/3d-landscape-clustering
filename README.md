## Reshaping Urban Landscape Factorization through 3D Landscape Clustering

As urban populations continue to grow, managing urban heat and its environmental impacts becomes increasingly critical. Traditional methods for analyzing urban temperature dynamics often fail to capture the complexity of urban landscapes. Our research introduces the 3D Landscape Clustering (3LC) framework, a novel tool designed to enhance the analysis of urban temperature dynamics by factoring in detailed 3D landscape variables.

The 3LC framework clusters urban landscapes into homogeneous groups using high-resolution 3D land cover maps, providing deeper insights into the relationships between urban landscape features and temperature variations. This research represents a significant advancement in our understanding of how landscapes influence urban climates, contributing to more sustainable, climate-resilient cities.

**Stay tuned for the release of the code and datasets associated with this research, which will be available soon.**
